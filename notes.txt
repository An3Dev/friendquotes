Ideas:
 when to get 


Things I've learned:

- to make the message input box expand to all available free space, I should 
    give it flex: 1, and give the send button flex: 0 so that the input box
    gets all the priority

- always set views with no siblings to have flex: 1 if you want them to expand to the entire space

-  if a view is expanding vertically and you 
    don't want that, set its parent to row flex flexDirection
    and alignItems to flex-start

- when I was building the app to deploy on my phone(android), the app would crash as soon as it was opened
    even though it worked fine through expo go. I don't know exactly what fixed it, but I did these things:
        - changed the eas.json file to specify that I wanted an android build and an apk, and set 
            internal testing to true. The latter most likely doesn't matter
        - I used android log cat to see what error message i got when the app crashed. It said something 
            related to a screens plugin not being installed. So I looked the error up and installed 
            many plugins like gesture handler, react navigation stack and native, and others.
    I think that's all I did to fix it.
