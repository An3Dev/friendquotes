- quote view, and all messages view


Things I've learned:

- to make the message input box expand to all available free space, I should 
    give it flex: 1, and give the send button flex: 0 so that the input box
    gets all the priority

- always set views with no siblings to have flex: 1 if you want them to expand to the entire space

-  if a view is expanding vertically and you 
    don't want that, set its parent to row flex flexDirection
    and alignItems to flex-start
